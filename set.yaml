  Shaping:
    notes:
      - Not sure how I feel about this one. I worry it'll be too snowbally in Limited and meaningless (always on) in Constructed.
    description: |
      Shaping is an ability word that groups abilities that cares about whether or not the player has at least as many auras as each other player (i.e. abilities that affect/are available to the player(s) with the most auras).
  Reshape:
    notes:
      - Worry about having this, and Shaping, and Entrust all together. Might also step on Aura swap's toes? Might play nicely with it though...

      Reshape is a keyword action meaning move an Aura you control from one valid target to another.
  Aura swap:
    notes:
      - Returning mechanic.
